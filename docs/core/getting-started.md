# Getting started with .NET Core

.NET Core runs on [Windows](#windows), [Linux](#linux), and [macOS / OS X](#os-x--macos).

## Windows

Install .NET Core on [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows). 

You can get started developing .NET Core apps by following these step-by-step tutorials.

* [Getting started with .NET Core on Windows, using Visual Studio 2015](tutorials/using-on-windows.md) - Use [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/), the full-featured integrated development environment (IDE) for Windows.  
* [Getting started with .NET Core on macOS, using Visual Studio Code](tutorials/using-on-macos.md) - Use [Visual Studio Code](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/code-vs), Microsoft's lightweight cross-platform code editor. This tutorial is written for macOS, but Visual Studio Code also works on Windows.
* [Getting started with .NET Core using the command line](tutorials/using-with-xplat-cli.md) - Use any code editor with the [.NET Core cross-platform command-line interface (CLI)](tools/index.md).

See the [Prerequisites for Windows development](windows-prerequisites.md) topic for a list of the supported Windows versions.
