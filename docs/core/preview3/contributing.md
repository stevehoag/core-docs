# Using the preview3 folder and sub-folders

This folder is the top-level node that matches the tools
folder, but contains deltas for the .NET Core Tools RC4 release.

The goal of this separate parallel folder structure is to provide a location
for the RC4 release related content that can be relatively easily merged into
the main structure when provide version switching in the published site.

The content under this node should be a smaller document set that represents
the deltas from the Long Term Support (LTS) release and the latest
current release. 

## Structure

There are two cases to adding new content for this release:

* Changes to existing documents
    - Copy the existing content into a parallel folder under this structure. Make your changes, and add the modified file to the TOC for the RC4 release.
* New documents
    - Put the new document in the proper location, and add it to the TOC under the node for the RC4 release. 

All current release files should have the following added near the
top of the topic:

[!include[current release track](../includes/warning.md)]

We've created a snippet to include with the following syntax:

```markdown
[!include[current release track](../../includes/warning.md)]
```

### Link instructions

In both cases, provide links from current release to the LTS page (or parent index.md)
for navigational purposes.
Consider providing links from the LTS page (or parent index.md) to the
new current release content page.

## Future Considerations

Our end goal is to surface different releases as branches in the
[docs repo](https://github.com/dotnet/docs). Until that publishing
scenario is supported, we'll use different top-level folders for each
current release. 

When the time comes, we can merge each current release into the main
[docs](../docs) folder, merge the TOC nodes, and publish as a separate doc
set. We may need to merge modifications to both the LTS version of a file
and the current release of a file, but we should be able to find those
changes relatively easily.
