## Name

`dotnet-restore` - Restores the dependencies and tools of a project.

## Synopsis

`dotnet restore [root] [--help] [--source]  
    [--packages] [--disable-parallel] [--configfile] 
    [--no-cache] [--ignore-failed-sources] [--no-dependencies]`

## Description

The `dotnet restore` command uses NuGet to restore dependencies as well as project-specific tools that are specified in the project file. 
By default, the restoration of dependencies and tools are done in parallel.

In order to restore the dependencies, NuGet needs the feeds where the packages are located. 
Feeds are usually provided via the NuGet.config configuration file; a default one is present when the CLI tools are installed. 
You can specify more feeds by creating your own NuGet.config file in the project directory. 
Feeds can also be specified per invocation on the command prompt. 

For dependencies, you can specify where the restored packages are placed during the restore operation using the 
`--packages` argument. 
If not specified, the default NuGet package cache is used. 
It is found in the `.nuget/packages` directory in the user's home directory on all operating systems (for example, */home/user1* on Linux or *C:\Users\user1* on Windows).

For project-specific tooling, `dotnet restore` first restores the package in which the tool is packed, and then
proceeds to restore the tool's dependencies as specified in its project file.

## Options

`[root]` 
    
Optional path to the project file to restore. 

`-h|--help`

Prints out a short help for the command.

`-s|--source <SOURCE>`

Specifies a NuGet package source to use during the restore operation. This overrides all of the sources specified in the NuGet.config file(s). Multiple sources can be provided by specifying this option multiple times.

`--packages <PACKAGES_DIRECTORY]`

Specifies the directory to place the restored packages in. 

`--disable-parallel`

Disables restoring multiple projects in parallel. 

`--configfile <FILE>`

The NuGet configuration file (NuGet.config) to use for the restore operation.

`--no-cache`

Specifies to not cache packages and HTTP requests.

` --ignore-failed-sources`

Only warn about failed sources if there are packages meeting version requirement.

`--no-dependencies`

When restoring a project with P2P references, do not restore the references, just the root project. 

## Examples

Restore dependencies and tools for the project in the current directory:

`dotnet restore` 

Restore dependencies and tools for the `app1` project found in the given path:

`dotnet restore ~/projects/app1/app1.csproj`
	
Restore the dependencies and tools for the project in the current directory using the file path provided as the fallback source:

`dotnet restore -f c:\packages\mypackages` 

Restore the dependencies and tools for the project in the current directory using the two file paths provided as the fallback sources:

`dotnet restore -f c:\packages\mypackages -f c:\packages\myotherpackages` 

Restore dependencies and tools for the project in the current directory and shows only errors in the output:

`dotnet restore --verbosity Error`
