# Docker on .NET Framework

You can learn more about Windows Containers, including what they are and the requirements for running them, on the [Windows Containers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/about_overview) and [Getting Started with Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) articles. 

You can begin by [moving a console application to Docker](console.md).
If you are more interested in an ASP.NET MVC application, try the
[ASP.NET MVC application in Docker](aspnetmvc.md).
