# .NET Framework on Docker Guide

The .NET Framework is a development platform for building applications for Windows, Windows Phone, Windows Server, and Microsoft Azure. It consists of the common language runtime (CLR) and the .NET Framework class library, which includes classes, interfaces, and value types that support an extensive range of technologies. The .NET Framework provides a managed execution environment, simplified development and deployment, and integration with a variety of programming languages, including Visual Basic, Visual C# and F#.

Check out [Docker on .NET Framework](docker/index.md) to learn how to run your existing applications on [Windows Containers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/about_overview).
