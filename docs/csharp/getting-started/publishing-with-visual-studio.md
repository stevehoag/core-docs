# Publishing Your Hello World Application with Visual Studio 2015 #

Now that you've created your console app (in the [Building a Hello World Appllication with .NET Core in Visual Studio 2015](.\with-visual-studio.md) topic) and debugged it (in the [Debugging Your Hello World Application with Visual Studio 2015](.\debugging-with-visual-studio.md) topic), you can publish your application. This allows you to distribute your application and to run it outside of Visual Studio. To publish and run your application:

1. Make sure that Visual Studio is building the release version of your application. If necessary, change change the build configuration setting on the toolbar from **Debug** to **Release**, as shown in the following figure.

2. Right-click on the HelloWorld project (not the HelloWorld solution) and select **Publish** from the menu. You can also select **Publish HelloWorld** from the main Visual Studio **Build** menu.

3. When the **Profile** tab of the **Publish** dialog box shown in the following figure appears, select the **File System** target.

4. In the **New Custom Profile** dialog box, enter a profile name, such as `Hello World Release`.

5. The **Connection** tab of the **Publish** dialog box specifies the directory in which Visual Studio will publish your app. Select **Next** to accept the default location, the project's `bin\Release\PublishOutput` subdirectory. The following figure shows the **Connection** tab.

6. In the **Settings** tab of the **Publish** dialog, which is shown in the following figure, confirm that you are publishing the correct version of your app. In this case, we are publishihg the release version that targets .NET Core 1.0 and runs on all platforms that support .NET Core. Select **Publish** to publish your app to the target directory.

The project's .\bin\release\PublishOutput directory contains your published app. Because this application has no platform-specific dependencies (such as calls to a third-party library that is supported only on specific platforms, or calls to operating system APIs), it runs on any platform on which .NET Core has been installed.

You run the app with the [.NET Core Command Line Interface](../../core/tools/index.md) (CLI) by using the following command:


```console
dotnet helloworld.dll
```

To distribute it, you can simply copy the files generated by the publishing operation to any computer that has .NET Core installed. Note that the output includes a symbol (.pdb) file that you do not have to distribute with your app.

For more information on publishing and deploying a .NET Core application, see [.NET Core Application Deployment](../../core/deploying/index.md).
